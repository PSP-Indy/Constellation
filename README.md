# Leviathan

## About Seamoth
Leviathan is a c++ project aimed at creating a cohesive and robust control system for the MATE ROV competition. It is a spiritual successor to our previous python library Sea Moth that had a similar goal. The project is built by the Mamaroneck High School Robotics Team and named for the iconic giant creatures in the video game Subnautica by Unknown Worlds Entertainment.
