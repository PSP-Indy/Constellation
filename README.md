# Leviathan

## About Leviathan
Leviathan is a c++ project aimed at creating a cohesive and robust control system for the MATE ROV competition. It is a spiritual successor to our previous python library Seamoth that had a similar goal. The project is built by the Mamaroneck High School Robotics Team and named for the iconic giant creatures in the video game Subnautica by Unknown Worlds Entertainment. The application features a comprehensive, fast, and modern UI that allows you to view camera views, telemetry data and debug output all on one interface, along with native controller integration, and built in communication protocols designed specifically to integrate with [Snowfox](https://github.com/mamorobotics/Snowfox).

Leviathan is the compliment to our other C++ project, [Snowfox](https://github.com/mamorobotics/Snowfox), and is designed to run on the control box as a standalone compiled binary.
