# Leviathan
Leviathan is an application designed to communicate and control our robot for the MATE Rov competition. It is a successor to our previous project Seamoth, written in python, which we found didnt have the power or strength to run our robot at a full capacity. This project is designed to be more integrated and robust than our previous code bases.
